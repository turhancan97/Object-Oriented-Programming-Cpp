/*(Health application: BMI) The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight.
It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of
your height in metres. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in
pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note that one pound is
0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 metres.*/
