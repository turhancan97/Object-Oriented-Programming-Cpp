/*(Science: wind chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not
enough to provide the answer. Other factors such as wind speed, humidity and and
sunshine play important roles in determining the coldness outside. In 2001, the US
National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to
measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 F and 41
F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 mph and displays the wind-chill
temperature. Use pow(a , b) to compute v^0.16*/
