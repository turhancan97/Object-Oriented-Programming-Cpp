# Object Oriented Programming in C++

## About C++
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.
- C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
- C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

## Usage of C++

By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

-   Window application
-   Client-Server application
-   Device drivers
-   Embedded firmware etc

 ## 4. Advance CPP
- **qualifier** - There are 2 type of qualifier :- Modification and life duration qualifiers 
- **Modification qualifiers** - There are 3 type of Modification qualifier :- Const, volatile, mutable
- **Life duration qualifiers** - There are 3 type of Life duration qualifiers :- static, register, extern
