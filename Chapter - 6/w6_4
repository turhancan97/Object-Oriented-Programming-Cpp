/*Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. 
Write a program to play a variation of the game, as follows:
	Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2,…, and 6, respectively.
	Check the sum of the two dice. 
	If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established.
	Continue until you roll either a 7 (you lose) or the same point value (you win).
	Your program acts as a single player.*/
